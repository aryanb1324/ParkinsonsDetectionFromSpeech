# ParkinsonsDetectionFromSpeech
WIP
Updating this project every week or so.

**LOG**<br/> 
Just finished the first model for this project! it is linear regression, and with the base model we got 90% accuracy. still have a lot more we can change, but thats a good starting spot!


- [x] try linear reg - 0.9411764705882353
- [ ] try log reg
- [ ] try knn
- [ ] naive bayes (promising because of heatmap)
- [ ] decision trees and that whole mess
- [ ] SVM (need to reseawrch mroe)
- [ ] k means clustering
- [ ] NEURAL NETWORKS! (more research needed for this)


the biggest next step is to be able to convert audio into the file format that this model will be trained on! <br/> 
note: research paper should be at least avaliable before the end of next year! (hoping to get it published too)

**LOG**<br/> 
finished log reg, but because the dataset is really imbalanced, i had to learn how to balance it out. from now on the accuracy will be measured thru f1 score, because that is the most accurate and industry standard


- [x] try linear reg - 0.9411764705882353
- [x] try log reg - 0.9230769230769231
- [ ] try knn
- [ ] naive bayes (promising because of heatmap)
- [ ] decision trees and that whole mess
- [ ] SVM (need to reseawrch mroe)
- [ ] k means clustering
- [ ] NEURAL NETWORKS! (more research needed for this)<br/>
linear reg is currenr leader! <br/>
the future decisions for which model to pursue will be in like a deicision tree format, with the hghest base accuracy being the one i pursue.
